-----------------------------------------------Week 1----------------------------------------------------------
JavaSript doesnt have print function

Data is displayed on the screen by
	an alert box using window.alert() --gives a pop-up with ok button 
	a prompt using window.prompt() ---- gives a pop-up with an input field
	HTML ouput using document.write() --- writes directly to the screen
	HTML element using innerHTML() --- replaces the content of the DOM (No parenthesis)
	the browser console using comsole.log()------used in debugging

alert("Message") gives a pop-up window

<script> tag is used to write JS in HTML file

a variable is declared by prefixing it with "var" (variables are case-sensitive) 

Datatypes => 
	Numerical values
	String (value is put in quotes)Boolean (trues/false)(without quotes)
	Object (they have attributes)
	Array  

Equality (==)
Equality with type (===)
And (&&)
Or (||)

-------------------------------------------------Week 2----------------------------------------------------------

Functions start with the keyword "function" 

Functions can be declared inside the head tag 

Events -
	onclick =
	onload = when the page gets loaded
	onresize = 
	onmouseover = 
	onchange = 

to change the style of an element we do =  element.style.color="blue";

"this" keyword is used to reference the current element

-------------------------------------------------Week 3 ----------------------------------------------------

Arrays ---

Ways of declaring array-
	var grades=[80.97,65,43];
	var foods= ['bananas','apples','pizza'];
	var images=document.getElementsByClassName['imgs'];
	var listItems= document.getElementsByTagName['li'];

elements in array can be of different type

we can add elements in array by using push()

Loop syntax is same as in C

------------------------------Week 4-----------------------------------

Forms - 
	Tags used --
		<form> tells the browser its a form.
		<label>matches different text on the screen with the actual input that u put in
		<input>(most imp)

Attributes--
	type = {
		text = text boxes
		radio = radio buttons( can select only one) 
		submit = submit buttons(can  select many)

	value = default values put in text boxes

	marked = default values checked in radio buttons

	target = to open link{
		_self = default value, same tab
		_blank= different tab

	action = any action to be performed, destinstion url to send form 

	checked = {true,false} (for default value in checkboxes and radio-buttons )

	method = {get, post}
		get = (default),shows data in the url, for bookmarking the form, url limit 3000
		post = for sensitive info, no size limit, can send large data

	name = most imp, acts as id/class, if omitted cant send data to server

Ways to Validate = 
	HTML5 input types = brower validates, focuses first values to validate, may not be supported by browser
	HTML5 attributes = {
		required = always have to be filled
		novalidate = ignore all other attributes (for testing)
		pattern =  works only with [input=test], use [html5pattern.com] for this(better)
	}
	Javascript funtions

to compare only the particualar values of an element use element.value

putting <label> tag on checkboxes lets u check the box by clicking on the text also

<fieldset> tag makes an outline on the whole element and using <legend> tag with in will put the text in between the outline
