--------------------------------------------WEEK 2--------------------------------------------------------

display property lets u decide how many elements u can fix in a line
	values = {inline, block, inline-block, none}
		none makes the element disappear

we can use display values such as table and table cell

Float property posititons the element as far as they can be and clears up its previous place

Overflow property is used when the text dosent fit in the element
	values = {visisble, hidden, scroll, auto}

Border property should have border style(compulsory)
	style = {none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, hidden}
	width = set in pixels or thin, medium, or large

border-width: can have 1, 2, 3 or 4(clockwise) values 

margin is the space outside your border( between u and neighbouring element)

padding is addititonal space between the element and its border

the lowest to highest ==> element text, padding , border, margin

Links have states-
	a:link = a normal, unvisisted link
	a:visited = has been visited
	a:hover = activated by mouse (MUST come after a:link and a:visited)
	a:focus = activated with the keyborad
	a:active = is being clicked (MUST come after a:hover)

Styling lists has properties 
	list-style-type = values{lower-roman,upper-roman, decimal, decimal-leading-zero, upper-aplha, lower-aplha, hebrew, armenian .....}
	list-style-img = can be any image
		values = {first_value= square,circle,discs    second_value= url('name_of_img')}

CSS selectors
	nav a = (every a tag in nav)
	nav > a = (every a tag which is direct child of nav(comes directly under nav)) 
	hl + ol = (same level and follow each other)

	Operators
		a[href^='https'] = (^) matches the beginning exactly
		$ = matches the end exactly
		* = anywhere

Prefixes  (www.caniuse) makes the code compatible with many browsers

--------------------------------------------------Week 3--------------------------------------------------

Transititons are used to add animations to your page.
	
Transition Properties =
	transition-property = properties u want to change 
	transition-duration 
	transition-delay = times after which transition starts
	transition-timing-function

Transforms are like transitions but they can change element in 2d and 3d 
as well

transform:translate(x,y) = moves element x,y pixels (according to catesian)
		 :rotate(xdeg) = always put deg
		 :scale(width,height)= 
		 :skew(xdeg,ydeg)
		 :matrix()

		 :rotate(x,y,z) 
		 :rotateX()
		 :rotateY()
		 :rotateZ()

Position = values {static, relative, absolute, fixed}
	fixed is used for elements that have to be fixed on screen and will be there even if u scroll.

EXTRA NOTES:
cascading stylesheets effects preference:
browser default -> external stylesheet -> internal stylesheet -> inline style

Rule precedence:
if 1 selector defined in 2 files -> rule from most reecent file is used 
if 1 selector has more than 1 rule in same file -> the most recent one 

!important -  to overide later rules
